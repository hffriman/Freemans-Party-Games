<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I created this game as my first project on the Godo Engine.</p>
<p>It all started with a funny dice game idea I had created in my head. When I started bringing that idea to life, I asked to create a lotto number generator.</p>
<p>This is the reason why this game is a collection of both the dice game and the lotto generator.</p>


<h2>Game 1: Dice Game</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Throw two dices</li>
  <li>Guess what their outcome could be (between 1-12)</li>
  <li>Draw one of the five operator cards: addition (+), substraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) and exponentation (^).</li>
  <li>The final result will be in the following  form: [dice 1] [operator] [dice2]. Find out if your guess was correct!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Game 2: Lotto Generator</h2>
